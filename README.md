## Release Notes


Hi, I'm the developer of the little tree, to test the true result, `run the version from the available executables`, as you may experience compile errors if you don't use an IDE, and load all the source documents.

For more information contact the support of this program.




## Para ejecutar o compilar

Check if you have c compiler in your pc, open terminal or bash and type:
`gcc --version` if this code doesn't work try: `cc --version`.

If you have the version of you compiler you try this in your terminal or bash:
